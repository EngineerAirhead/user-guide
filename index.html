                        A few things to keep in mind while interacting with this unique specimen of the <strong>Homo sapiens</strong> are listed below.<br />
                        If any or all of the provided information is unclear in any way, feel free to use any of the social links available on this page.

                <h3 class="section-title"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Personality</h3>
                <div class="summary">
                    <p>When trying to explain the personality of this specimen, it is perhaps easier to sum up a few of its characteristics.</p>
                    <h3>Curious</h3>
                    <p>
                        Born literally with his face towards the world, this specimen always had some curiosity within its system.
                        This became both his most powerful trait as well as his biggest flaw.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Always wanting to know how things worked or why decisions were made.
                        It's what made him go for a career within web development after a failed year in mechanical engineering.
                        Both being on the problem solving side of the career tree, he rather wanted to dive head first into actually doing stuff rather than dive into the books.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trait flourished once he learned how to make friends and have meaningful conversations with them.
                        Trying to think of new original questions to ask and getting to know the other a bit more with each question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This would also become his biggest flaw.<br />
                        Not always thinking about the consequences and just asking to feed his curiosity led to many difficult situations.
                        Many of which, he got out of by talking and apologising.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Stubborn</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not one to just take <strong>NO</strong> for an answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Combined with curiosity, this forms his biggest annoying feature.
                        Always going that extra mile to know why. Always pushing forward to make sure he gets the most out of something.
                        And not wanting to give up on things that easily when things seem to fall apart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A second downside is that, because if this feature, this creature finds it difficult to request help from others.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Loyal</h3>
                    <p>
                        As described below, social interactions aren't easy for this specimen.
                        But once a bond has been created, he will move mountains to make sure the bond will remain intact throughout whatever hardship will come along.
                        The size of the mountain will depend on the size of the bond. But rest assured, he will most definitely try whatever he can!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Kind / Caring</h3>
                    <p>
                        Keeping the bonds in mind, he will make sure that there is a place to crash for whoever is in need to escape.
                        Having had the issue of surviving most of his youth under the caring roof of his parents without anyone else to rely on,
                        he knows how hard it can be when you have nowhere else to go to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When in need of advise, be sure to ask him whatever you need to ask.
                        He will consider it a compliment regardless of the question and will try to give the best possible bit of advise based on the situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do keep in mind that this does mean that he can sometimes kick you down a bit further just to help you back up again.
                        Or in the words of Alfred Pennyworth:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>Why do we fall sir?<br />So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.</blockquote>
                    <h3>Funny</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>WARNING: Contains a dark sense of humor not suited for all audiences!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being mentioned, this specimen tends to make fun of himself to bring a smile on others.
                        Using whatever means necessary to keep the good mood going.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this has resulted in many good bonds still going strong, this has also been a great tool to communicate with new people.
                        Using both his self-knowledge and his surrounding to make the best possible remark.
                        This does include moments when (self)harm has been done to this specimen.
                    </p>

            <section class="section summary-section" id="social">
                <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fa fa-wechat"></i>Social interaction</h2>

                    <p>
                        Studies have shown that this creature is capable of interacting with other specimen within the same species.
                        As well as the occasional conversation with members of the Felidae and Canidae family.<br >
                        <small>Although studies are still unsure if this has to do with the animal characteristics within the creature itself.</small><br />
                        The mental structure of this creature however, prevents it from going out and meeting new people.
                        Which can lead to unexpected behaviour when forced into social activities with strangers or when asking questions like:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>Why don't you go out and meet new people?</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This can provoke the creature as he could not be cared enough to give a normal answer.
                        Resulting in many different flavours of sarcastic replies and comments, mostly along the way of:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>Because I can't. This mental representation of me is unable to just 'go out' and 'meet new people'. It is hardwired to a specific interaction with people that grows over time. And is not yet fully developed enough to do what you ask of me!</blockquote>
                    <p>Which basically translates to:</p>
                    <blockquote>Go fuck yourself.</blockquote>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        The above does not mean that this creature will avoid any and all forms of social interaction.
                        When given enough time, it will try and create a bond with people who are around him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to help it create a bond with you, one of the following things can be done:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start a normal conversation.</li>
                        <li>Compliment him about getting out of bed.</li>
                        <li>Ask him weird questions (but only if you want an answer).</li>
                        <li>Buy him a drink (non-alcoholic if he still needs to drive).</li>
                        <li>Be yourself <strong>Important!</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                        This creature isn't all work and no play.
                        Although he does like to write some (a lot) code in his free time, there are other things he enjoys doing.<br />
                        Not limited to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Playing games (video & board)</li>
                        <li>Watching movies/series</li>

                        <li>Drinking (preferably with friends)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This creature can sometimes even be found outside of his house or office to enjoy nature.
                        Most of the time while doing some volunteering work at an historic open air museum (NO... NOT LARP!).
                        Or just to get some fresh air.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this might not look like his natural surrounding, we advise not to drag him back inside!
                        Being outside is important for the development of this specimen!<br />
                        When possible, take him outside on a regular basis.
                    </p>

                        Like many other specimen within the IT branch of society, this one too tends to survive on beer and pizza.
                        If not taken care of in the right way, it could spend his weekends on the couch ordering over the phone.

                        That does not mean that this creature has no cooking skills or never does any grocery shopping.
                        Being aware of the risks that come with an unhealthy diet, he tends to make sure that he eats something different every day (holidays not included).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When other members of society are involved with dinner, he will try and cook a decent meal consisting of meat, vegetables and potatoes.
                        Or make a killer spaghetti when the ingredients are available.<br />
                        <small>Vegetarian is always an option as long as it is communicated in advance!</small><br />
                        In any other case he will do as he pleases by simply heating up something quick and easy.

                        While most members of the Homo sapiens family are diurnal, this example tends to lean towards a nocturnal cycle of living.
                        This has to do with the fact that most of the entities this specimen has bonded with over time live within the same time region, providing a constant source of distraction during the day.
                        Making it a lot easier to get things done during the night.

                    <p>
                        Combining that with an average need of 6 to 8 hours of sleep, tends to destroy this specimen.
                        It is therefore advised to force him to bed whenever able, so that he can get his sleep and be a productive member of society on the next day.

                        As part of his personality, this creature tends to overthink a lot of things when not distracted by an outside source.
                        He will therefor put on relaxing music to calm his mind and help him get to sleep.<br />
                        In case there are other people in the same room, earplugs will be used so that he will not bother the rest with his taste of music.
